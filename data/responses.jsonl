I am a professor at Stanford University in the computer science department. I believe that private firms have too much influence on the trajectory of the NLP field. I think that private firms have driven NLP in directions that are mainly focused on profit rather than on pushing the fundamental science forward. Many recent advances in NLP have been made by private firms in the pursuit of business goals such as better chatbots, rather than scientific breakthroughs that help us understand language and cognition. I believe the field would benefit from more university and publicly funded research that does not have to cater to the demands of the market.
